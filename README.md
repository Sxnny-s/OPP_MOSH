# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Programming with Mosh

In this video from **Programming with Mosh**, Mosh Hamedani explains the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data in the form of fields (also known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of procedures (also known as methods). This video is a great introduction for developers looking to understand OOP principles in depth.


## Introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming is a style of programming that is based on the concept of objects. In an OOP approach, each object is an instance of a class, which defines its properties and behaviors. The goal of OOP is to organize and structure software design in a way that is modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.

## Four Key Pillars of OOP

Mosh covers the four fundamental principles of OOP that form the foundation for designing and building software using this paradigm:

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It also restricts access to some of the object's components, which is a way to prevent the accidental modification of data. This is usually achieved by using access modifiers like `public`, `private`, or `protected`.
